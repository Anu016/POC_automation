Note: Currently we have two options of Cloud Based Selenium Grid, one is LambdaTest, the other is BrowserStack. It requiers we set the environment variable REMOTE_URL properly before running tests.

For LambdaTest: set REMOTE_URL=https://${username}:${accesskey}@hub.lambdatest.com/wd/hub e.g. https://leo.liang:fL1GyycafGz0bi45KrIsQ9KgZhQ50QoO4VoRzINoC9QUazxIlN@hub.lambdatest.com/wd/hub

For BrowserStack: set REMOTE_URL=http://${username}:${accesskey}@hub.browserstack.com:80/wd/hub e.g. http://leoliang3:tF9U3xRrWHMUByqDJQz8@hub.browserstack.com:80/wd/hub
